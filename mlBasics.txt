Machine learning: Finding hidden patterns in data to help us in some way.
Example: 1) Making sense from scientic results;
         2) Improve user experience;
         3) Maximize profit in investment.

Supervised learning: Learn from data when we have labels for the data seen so far.
Example: Filter e-mail as SPAM or NOT SPAM in gmails.

Unsupervised Learning: Discover hidden patterns in data when there are NO lables.
Example: Group news by categoy like google news.

Every ML probem has a data set (collection of data points).
