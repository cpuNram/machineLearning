Machine learning:
----------------
Finding hidden patterns in data to help us in some way.
Example: 1) Making sense from scientic results;
         2) Improve user experience;
         3) Maximize profit in investment.

Supervised learning:
-------------------
Learn from data when we have labels for the data seen so far.
Example: Filter e-mail as SPAM or NOT SPAM in gmails.

Unsupervised Learning:
---------------------
Discover hidden patterns in data when there are NO lables.
Example: Group news by categoy like google news.


Every ML probem has a data set (collection of data points). 


Clustering:
-----------
Clustering is unsupervised learning problem where we find the hidden patterns
from a data set, group them accordingly to some similarity. Group data according
to similarity. Group/Data/Similarity are three key words.


Classification:
---------------
Classification is supervised learning problem. In classification problem, bunch
of data points with labels are given. Then the goal would be to find labels for
any remaining unlabeled data points. That is, our goal will be to predict labels
for new data points given the labels at all data points.
